# Affective_Polarisation

This repo conatins a simple python 3 script that models how affective polarisation spreads throughout a population depending on various pre set paramenters.

It takes these parameters then simulates the population for a set number of time steps or until the population reaches the absorbing states of either full polarisaion (every person has a polarisation of 1) or zero polariasation (every person has a polarisation of 0).

Try it out!
